Testing Flap type casting with full type names:

Original value: 42.70
  as int8:   42
  as int16:  42
  as int32:  42
  as int64:  42

Unsigned value: 255.90
  as uint8:  255
  as uint16: 255
  as uint32: 255
  as uint64: 255

Float value: 3.1415926536
  as float32: 3.141593
  as float64: 3.1415926536

âœ“ All type names use full form (int32, uint64, float32, etc.)
