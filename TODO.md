# Flapc TODO - x86_64 Focus

## Current Sprint (x86_64 only)
- [ ] **SIMD intrinsics** - Vector operations for audio DSP, graphics effects, particle systems
- [ ] **Register allocation improvements** - Better register usage for performance
- [ ] **Dead code elimination** - Remove unused code from output
- [ ] **Constant propagation across functions** - Optimize constants through call boundaries
- [ ] **Inline small functions automatically** - Performance optimization

## Future stdlib (architecture-agnostic)

- [ ] **Collections** - Hash map, tree, queue, stack
- [ ] **String manipulation** - split, join, replace, regex
- [ ] **File I/O library** - High-level wrappers for file operations
- [ ] **Network programming** - Sockets, HTTP
- [ ] **JSON parsing and serialization** - Configuration and data exchange
- [ ] **Date/time library** - Timing and scheduling utilities
