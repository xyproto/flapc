# Flap 1.6.0 Implementation Status

## Completed Features

### 1. Language Specification (LANGUAGE.md)
- ✅ Complete rewrite of concurrency model
- ✅ ENet networking syntax documented (`:port` literals)
- ✅ Parallel loops syntax documented (`N @`, `@@`)
- ✅ Fork/background processes documented (`&` operator)
- ✅ Hot reload syntax documented (`hot` keyword)
- ✅ All grammar rules updated

### 2. Hot Reload Infrastructure  
- ✅ `hot` keyword parsing
- ✅ Function pointer table generation
- ✅ Code extraction from ELF binaries
- ✅ Executable memory allocation (mmap)
- ✅ File watching (inotify)
- ✅ Incremental state tracking
- ❌ Final integration (live patching) - needs wiring

### 3. Fork & Background Processes (WIP)
- ✅ BackgroundExpr AST node
- ✅ Code generation (fork syscall, child/parent branching)
- ❌ Parser integration - conflicts with `&` as list tail operator
- Needs: Operator precedence resolution

## Remaining Work for 1.6.0

### Critical Blockers

1. **ENet Networking Protocol** (VERY HIGH)
   - Implement protocol as machine code generation
   - Port literal lexing/parsing
   - Message send/receive loops
   - String port hashing

2. **Parallel Loops Runtime** (HIGH)
   - Thread pool implementation
   - Work-stealing queue
   - OpenMP-style work distribution

3. **Fix Fork Parsing** (MEDIUM)
   - Resolve `&` operator ambiguity
   - Background execution vs. list tail

4. **Complete Hot Reload** (HIGH)
   - Wire watch mode to running process
   - Extract changed function code
   - Live injection implementation

## Test Status

- ✅ Go test suite passes
- ✅ All existing Flap tests pass  
- ⚠️  New features not tested (not implemented)

## Recommendation

Focus next on:
1. Parallel loops (most straightforward runtime)
2. ENet networking (most complex, needs research)
3. Fix fork parsing (operator disambiguation)
4. Hot reload integration (needs IPC design)
